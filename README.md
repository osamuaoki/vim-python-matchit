==================

This is a clone of the [Python matchit](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=386)
plugin from vim.org, based on script version `0.5`.

This is cloned from https://github.com/voithos/vim-python-matchit as
https://github.com/osamuaoki/vim-python-matchit

'for'/'while'-block can take 'else' in Python.  This mod 0.5.1 addresses this situation.
